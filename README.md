# weather-data-analysis-prediction
A machine learning project for analyzing and predicting weather patterns using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Includes time-series decomposition, data visualization, and regression models.
This Weather Data Analysis and Prediction project focuses on analyzing historical weather data and building machine learning models to forecast future temperatures. Using Python along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and statsmodels, the project performs end-to-end data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies. It includes time-series decomposition to separate observed, trend, seasonal, and residual components, and implements regression models such as Linear Regression to predict future weather patterns. The predicted values are visualized and compared with actual data for clear interpretation, and the code is structured to be scalable and reusable for other datasets or cities. Overall, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to weather data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python and machine learning techniques.
